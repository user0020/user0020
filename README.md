Hey, I'm **Fikret H. Gungor**, a mathematics enthusiast, programmer and a radio amateur.\
I primarily focus on number theory and group theory, though I also occasionally program for fun or when needed.

I lost access to my old GitHub account [@855309](https://github.com/855309) due to 2FA issues, so this is my new profile.\
For my previous projects, you can check my old account or contact me.
